# Arduino based Burglar Alarm System with SMS and Call Notification

![Cover Image](link-to-your-cover-image.jpg)

## Introduction
This project is an Arduino-based burglar alarm system that provides SMS and call notifications. It uses PIR sensors to detect motion, Magnetic Reed switch to detect if a door or window had been opened and sends notifications to the user's phone. The system is designed to be affordable and easy to set up.

## Features
1. **Motion Detection**: 
   - ![Motion Detection Image](link-to-motion-detection-image.jpg)
   - The system uses 4 PIR sensors to detect motion arounf the 4 walls of a building.
2. **Door unlock detection**:

   - The sysem uses a magnetic reed switch to detect unauthorized access to locked doors
3. **Emergency Siren**:
   - ![Emergencu Siren Notification](link-to-call-notification-image.jpg)
   - Upon detecting intruder activity or a security breach,the crazy sound from the high decibel buzzer goes off, The sould could scare away the intruder and it is more than loud enough to call the public's attention.
4. **Customized Alarm Arming Time**:

   - The device can be configured to be Armed at specific times of the day (e.g During times when you are not around)
5. **SMS Notification**:
   - ![SMS Notification Image](link-to-sms-notification-image.jpg)
   - When motion is detected, the system sends an SMS notification to the user's phone.
6. **Call Notification**:

   - In addition to SMS, the system can also make a call to alert the user of the intrusion.

## About
This project was inspired by my dear friend(Benjamnin) experience with security issues at his workshop. On several occasions, the neighboring shops had experinced break-ins at their shops and thft of their goods and belongings during the night periods, Benjamin gave me a call and said he need somethng that can notify him of unusal activity around his shop and probably makes an alarmingsound that calls the publi'sattention.
Soi thought od building somthing that can provide hima real-time informaiton of security breaches at the four sides of his shop and at his door entrance. I wanted to create a solution that not only detects intrusions but also alerts the user immediately through SMS and call notifications.

This project is part of my portfolio for [ALX Software Engineering], where I am currently studying software engineering. It has been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm excited to share my work with others.
